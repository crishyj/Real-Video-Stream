## AN Video Stream Platform Instance

When we say a clone or copy of Video Stream we mean an instance of Video Stream Platform Enterprisee and every instance of the Video Stream Platform can be indexed as a network in the World Wide Broadcast Network Platform System.

Management life cycle is as follows; media is managed at the platform at 1, media is then uploaded to a temporary storage to be encoded at 2, then stored for broadcast at 3, then distributed to devices at 1 to be consumed.

## Important Information

> Streamer can be installed on any Server, including Windows, but the encoder and Livestream should work fine on any Linux distribution. However we recommend Ubuntu 16+ without any kind of control panel.
> The problem with cPanel, Plesk, Webmin, VestaCP, etc. It's because we need full root access to install some libs, and maybe compile them. Another important point is that to make Livestream work, we need to compile Nginx and the control panels often prevent us from running the commands forcing the installation available only on your panel.

I donÂ´t want to read I just want you to show me how to install!!

# Video Stream - Streamer
Video Stream! is an video-sharing website, It is an open source solution that is freely available to everyone. With Video Stream you can create your own video sharing site, Video Stream will help you import and encode videos from other sites like Youtube, Vimeo, etc. and you can share directly on your website. In addition, you can use Facebook or Google login to register users on your site. The service was created in march 2017.


# Why do I need the Encoder?
You may want to install the encoder for a few reasons, such as, if you have a faster server than the public encoder server (which is likely to be the case), or if you'd like a private way of encoding your videos.

But, the installation is mandatory if you are using a private network. The public encoder will not have access to send the videos to your streamer site.

If your server does not have a public IP or uses an IP on some of these bands:
- 10.0.0.0/8
- 127.0.0.0/8 (Localhost)
- 172.16.0.0/12
- 192.168.0.0/16

Surely you need to install an encoder
